                    <h2>Understanding Speech Delay</h2>
                    <p>Speech delay is when a child's speech and language skills develop more slowly than expected. While this can be concerning for parents, it's important to remember that:</p>
                    <ul class="info-list">
                        <li>Every child develops at their own pace</li>
                        <li>Early intervention can significantly improve outcomes</li>
                        <li>Many children with speech delays catch up with appropriate support</li>
                        <li>Supporting communication is a team effort involving families, educators, and professionals</li>
                    </ul>
